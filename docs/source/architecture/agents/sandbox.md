# Deep Research Sandbox Notes

Deep research can optionally run DeepAgents `execute` calls through a sandbox provider
(Modal, OpenShell, or any registered provider). Modal and OpenShell create a fresh physical
sandbox per job. OpenShell binds the configured policy at creation and attests the authoritative
effective policy source, content, hash, and active revision before exposing the execution backend.
The pinned OpenShell 0.0.72 initial-policy compatibility path permits its zero generic/active
version fields only when the LOADED revision and effective config independently agree on the same
positive version and exact submitted policy/hash; other version disagreements fail closed.

The sandbox is an internal execution detail. There are no sandbox-specific API
endpoints, and job-level auth remains responsible for submit, stream, status,
cancel, state, and report access. The one user-visible surface is the artifact
runtime (`.../job/{job_id}/artifacts`), which is also auth-scoped to the job.

## Current Behavior

- Modal and OpenShell use one physical sandbox per deep research job. OpenShell shared
  attachment is available only through an explicit debug-only opt-in and is not job-isolated.
- Synchronous sandbox-enabled runs use an internal per-agent runtime ID.
- Providers are selected by config (`sandbox.provider` + `providers.<name>`); the
  provider is validated against the registry and gated by its declared capabilities.
  OpenShell policy YAML is parsed strictly against the installed SDK schema, applied in the
  job's creation spec, checked against the declared network upper bound (hostless/CIDR overrides
  are rejected), and attested through the gateway status/config RPCs before use.
- Job IDs must satisfy each provider's object-name rules (Modal: 64 chars or fewer,
  alphanumeric plus dash/period/underscore).
- `timeout` bounds individual execution. Other lifecycle controls are provider-dependent.
- Files written inside the workdir are temporary scratch state. Durable text should
  be written through DeepAgents virtual paths such as `/shared/`; durable binaries
  (charts, CSVs) are captured by the artifact runtime.

## Artifact Storage

Metadata for generated files such as charts and CSVs is stored in SQL. File content can
also be stored in SQL, but object storage such as AWS S3 or MinIO is recommended for
production deployments. The selected artifact storage provider determines where the file
content is stored.

For configuration variables and examples, see [Docker Compose](../../deployment/docker-compose.md#artifact-storage)
and [Production Considerations](../../deployment/production.md#artifact-storage).

## Operational Notes

- High-concurrency Modal and OpenShell runs create one sandbox per job. Optional submit-path
  caps (`AIQ_MAX_SANDBOXES_PER_PRINCIPAL` / `AIQ_MAX_SANDBOXES_GLOBAL`, default-off) bound
  concurrency and cost.
- Custom client-supplied job IDs must not be reused for a new job.
- The runtime closes provider sessions on success, failure, cancellation, and timeout.
- Per-job OpenShell mode requires `delete_on_exit: true`. A persistent shared sandbox is
  possible only through the explicit debug attachment settings.
- OpenShell provisioning (`setup_openshell.sh`) is separate from authenticated gateway
  lifecycle (`start_openshell_gateway.sh`). The launcher rejects plaintext/raw gateways and
  requires a successful disposable sandbox create/delete probe before AI-Q starts.

## Current Safeguards

The following safeguards are in place:

- Explicit sandbox cleanup on success, failure, cancellation, and timeout.
- Idempotency-gated retry-on-stale-container handling.
- Artifact capture for generated charts/binaries (validate -> store -> serve/embed),
  with MIME-from-bytes spoof rejection, SVG sanitization, and an inline-render allowlist.
- Sandbox quota and concurrency controls, and artifact retention via job-expiry cleanup.
- Structured lifecycle logging for sandbox create, reuse, failure, and cleanup.
- Structured `sandbox.attestation` and `sandbox.cleanup` events.
